Advanced Exercises
Exercise 1 | Iframes
Create a website with a nice heading (h1) with your name, and underneath
it, try to tell us about yourself using only iframes (you can be creative and
use the embedded map to show us the place you grew up, or your favorite
youtube video etc…)
Also, try to structure it nicely, consider the sizes of the iframes, using <hr>
for separation, etc…
